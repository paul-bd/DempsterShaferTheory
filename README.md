# Evidential Fully Connected Layer in pytorch
Basis of Dempster shafer theory

This is a pytorch reimplementation of the Evidencial Fully Convolutional Neural Network [Tong et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13549) in pytorch and largely inspired by the [native implementation](https://github.com/tongzheng1992/E-CNN-classifier)
